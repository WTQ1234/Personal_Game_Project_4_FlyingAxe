# Personal_Game_Project_4_ZumaCard
A personal game project in Unity, and I used odin.

Not for commercial use, the picture is from internet.

Because of the copyright, I remove the odin inspector plugin, you can get it from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041

downland the package above, and drag into the project, then it will work.

View it in the video: [https://youtu.be/DgpGetbsz1g](https://youtu.be/2WfUHhO6nis)

Play it by download in google drive: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jo-t6H5LK5t-DImaYwHhu7Vjwc7GQlw6/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ug6qSai7-asTtAxwUSEwrwCBZ0HzyU-_/view)https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ug6qSai7-asTtAxwUSEwrwCBZ0HzyU-_/view
